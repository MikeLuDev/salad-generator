## Features

This is a **progressive web application** which provides an installable experience for users on any internet accessible device.

Current features:

:heavy_check_mark: Generate a random salad with the press of a button

:heavy_check_mark: Enable/disable ingredients

:heavy_check_mark: Specify the amount of ingredients per type in generation

## Roadmap

- Ability to "hold" ingredients when generating OR regenerate specific ingredients
  - This will allow users to continue tweaking a salad which is good for most of the ingredients, but has one or two weird ones
- Ability to save salads

## Potential Ideas

- Download .pdf of recipes
- Upvote salads
  - Community favorites list
  - Machine learning to guide generation
- Seasonal salads
- Pictures of salads
- Serving size
- Calories
